# Word-Freq
Takes in a text file and output the frequency of each word in parallel. This program uses Hadoop MapReduce to take in a text file as input and determines the frequency of how often words appear in a file while doing it all in parallel using the MapReduce framework. This was an entry level program to get familiar with Hadoop and how MapReduce works.
